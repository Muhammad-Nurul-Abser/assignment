            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>To become a Web Developer, you should have an understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Itâ€™s also
                recommended to learn about CSS and CSS frameworks. Developing these fundamental web development skills
                will give you the foundation and logic for communicating with programming languages.</p>

            <h2>Vission</h2>
            <p>To become a prime performer, in providing quality Web, Print and Software solutions in the competitive
                global market place.</p>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>The role is responsible for designing, coding and modifying websites, from layout to function and
                according to a client's specifications. Strive to create visually appealing sites that feature
                user-friendly design and clear navigation.</p>

            <p>Focus more on the actual software design and allow the low-level implementation details to be a little
                dirtier as long as they are doing the right thing. A broken design will most likely compromise most
                deadlines and will destroy your motivation, while a not-so-dry but nicely designed working software will
                usually suffice.</p>
